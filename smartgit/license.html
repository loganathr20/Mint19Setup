			It is the responsibility of LICENSEE to ensure that SOFTWARE can exclusively be accessed and used only by its STAFF.
			LICENSEE must undertake measures to prevent unauthorized access and use.

			If LICENSEE is a company or any other legally recognized entity, every such user must belong to STAFF, as defined in 2.4.
		</p>

		<p>
			3.2.1.1&nbsp;Each user (person) must be nameable on demand.

			deactivated and LICENSEE gets the agreed-upon rights of use according to these license terms.
			Bypassing this technical protective function results in an immediate loss of all conceded rights of use.
			In this case a termination according to clause&nbsp;5 is no longer applicable.

	<div id="5.4">
		<p>
			5.4&nbsp;SOFTWARE comes with an optional "on-premise license server" component, which may be made available to the LICENSEE at the sole discretion of the LICENSOR.
			The on-premise license server provides services to retrieve SOFTWARE license certificates, without the need to distribute the license file to all users or requiring to get access to the Internet.
			The on-premise license server is deployed using a couple of artifacts, including but not limited to: source code, binaries, and the master license file.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="5.4.1">
		<p>
			5.4.1&nbsp;The on-premise license server may or may not restrict usage to the number of users agreed upon by the LICENSEE.
			The LICENSEE is responsible for regularly checking the number of active users, at least once in a quarter.
			If the number of users exceeds the agreed limit, the LICENSEE must inform the LICENSOR.
			In this case, the LICENSOR may charge for the users exceeding the limit.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="5.4.2">
		<p>
			5.4.2&nbsp;Access to the services of the on-premise license server must be limited to STAFF, as defined in 2.4.

			Under no circumstances should the services be made accessible to the public on the Internet.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="5.4.3">
		<p>
			5.4.3&nbsp;Access to the artifacts of the on-premise license server must only be granted to those STAFF members who are responsible for software license management for SmartGit.
			It is particularly important to protect the master license file and restrict access to the smallest amount of STAFF members.
			If any of the artifacts from the on-premise license server become leaked due to the negligence or actions of the LICENSEE, the LICENSOR retains the right to seek compensation for any damages incurred.

	<div id="6.2">
		<p>
			6.2&nbsp;LICENSEE's rights on indemnification due to a certain lack are excluded, if, for example, he has known the lack at the conclusion of the
			contract, especially when there had been a test phase before that date.
			If LICENSEE has not known of a lack due to gross negligence, he can only claim rights with respect to that lack if LICENSOR had fraudulently
			concealed the lack or had taken over a guarantee for the quality of that object.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="6.3">
		<p>
			6.3&nbsp;In case of data loss LICENSOR is only liable for the effort that would have been necessary for the recovery of the data, provided that the
			data backup was properly executed by LICENSEE.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="6.4">
		<p>
			6.4&nbsp;If a third party asserts rights against LICENSEE because of claimed infringement of SOFTWARE, LICENSEE is entitled to the rights defined in the corresponding sales contract.
			In case there is no sales contract or no such stipulation in the sales contract, LICENSOR is liable as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To cure, LICENSOR can, at its own expense, either change or replace SOFTWARE in such a way that it does not infringe the property rights, but still essentially corresponds to the stipulated functional and performance characteristics in a manner reasonable for LICENSEE,
				or LICENSOR can indemnify LICENSEE against claims by the holder of the property rights.
			</li>
			<li>
				If cure is impossible for LICENSOR or is possible only under disproportionate conditions, LICENSOR has the right to take back the respective SOFTWARE in exchange for reimbursement of the paid remuneration.
				In doing so, LICENSOR must grant LICENSEE a reasonable phase-out period, unless that is possible only under unreasonable legal or other conditions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			LICENSEE's other claims regarding section 6.2 remain unaffected.
		</p>
		<p>
			However this only applies, if LICENSEE immediately notifies LICENSOR about the claims of the third party, does not accept any claimed infringement and
			either leaves any legal actions, including possible out-of-court arrangements, to LICENSOR or only consummates them in agreement with LICENSOR.

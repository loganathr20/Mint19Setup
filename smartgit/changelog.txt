        - detect protected branches and in that case default to Create Pull Request
    - Graph: loads more commits when scrolling to the bottom

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Background commands:
    - for poll, disable partial clone logic
    - memory leak if Detect Local Changes was enabled
- Changes view, Resolve: possible error "Input length = ..." error for conflict files with specific encodings
- Move and Squash: could create # in commit message of the resulting commit though the original message did not contain #
- Refresh: possible problems with Git filter-invocations (low-level property core.git.invokeFilterDirectly)
- Syntax:
    - Clojure: symbols might contain some non-letter character
    - PHP: backslash in single-quoted strings was incorrectly parsed
    - TypeScript:
        - underscore in numbers was not allowed
        - "any", "number", "string" and "undefined" were not highlighted
- WSLg:
    - GUI was broken for 200% zoom level without configuring the low-level property ui.dpiFactor
- Standard window:
    - Feature commands: for multiple main branches wrong main branch was suggested
    - Configure Features:
        - accepted input which was rejected later
        - did not show remote-only branches
        - lost pattern-based configurations after reopening
        - switching back grom pattern to simple branch did not work
        - configuration was picked up delayed
    - Open (file): for some extensions wrong default tool was used (on Windows)
    - Mini-log: bold (pushable) commits were not identical in all cases with Graph

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Add or Create Repository:
    - if a path inside a repository is provided, open that repository
    - if a path inside a submodule is provided, ask whether to open the submodule or outer-most repository
- update bundled Git to 2.39.1 and Git-LFS 3.3.0
- theming:
    - make it easier to override only specific colors on top of an existing theme: https://docs.syntevo.com/SmartGit/Latest/Theme-Customization.html

- Syntax:
    - JSON: support // and /* ... */ as in TypeScript's tsconfig.json
- macOS: ignore events for disposed widgets causing assertions
- Log window:
    - Changes view: opening Submodule re-uses current window when selecting "Existing window"
    - Drop Local Data (for pull requests): works on multiple pull requests at once
- Standard window:
    - Commit: unset "Amend", if "Amend" was set automatically by clicking the HEAD commit in the mini-log, and the user edits the commit message
    - Files view:
        - if the space is not enough to display the full name or path, especially for renamed files, give the name more place
        - for renamed files, the renamed part is highlighted

    - Finish Feature: more efficient GitHub query (Finish dialog comes up faster)
    - Integrate Feature: in dialog-less mode, show warning for diverged main branch
    - My History view: if a local branch is different from its remote branch, show the remote branch as separate line below the local branch; this simplified selecting the remote branch in the Graph
    - Refresh:
        - performance improvements (by using a .git/index cache like the Log window)
        - reduced memory consumption for repositories containing many files
    - Tools main menu: contains only tools that operate on the repository root;
      if the tool should operate on a specific directory or file, invoke the tool from the directory's or file's context menu

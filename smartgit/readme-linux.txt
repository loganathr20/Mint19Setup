Installation
============
SmartGit requires a 64-bit Linux system.

SmartGit does not need to be installed; just unpack it to your preferred
location and launch the bin/smartgit.sh script. It comes with a bundled Git
that should work on newer Linux versions if libcurl 7.58+ is available. It
might be necessary to install libcurl, e.g. using the command

  $ sudo apt install libcurl4

on Ubuntu (or some similar command which is appropriate for your system).
By default, SmartGit will not use the system Git because it's usually old
and missing important functionality.

If for Git-LFS repositories you get an error about Git couldn't find lfs,
please set the low-level property "executable.addBinDirectoryToPath" to true.

Menu Item
---------
To create a menu item launch bin/add-menuitem.sh, to remove it later use
bin/remove-menuitem.sh.
